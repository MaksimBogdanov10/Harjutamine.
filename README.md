GitHub, Inc. was originally a flat organization with no middle managers; in other words, "everyone is a manager" (self-management).[16] Employees could choose to work on projects that interested them (open allocation), but salaries were set by the chief executive.[17][needs update]

In 2014, GitHub, Inc. introduced a layer of middle management amid harassment claims made against senior management. Tom Preston-Werner resigned as CEO amid the scandal.
